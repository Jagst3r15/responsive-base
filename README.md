===============

Responsive Base is a child theme built on the mobile first approach to responsive web design. It was created not to just be responsive, but to act as a template or starting point for child theme development for the Thematic Theme Framework. After creating quite a few Thematic based sites, I felt like I need a better base starting point which saves time and is already set up with some very useful modifications I frequently use.

Responsive Base is ideal for me. I created it for me, but thought others working with responsive themes for Thematic may find it useful. It is intended to work best with the latest version of Thematic, but works fine on 9.7.7 and above.
